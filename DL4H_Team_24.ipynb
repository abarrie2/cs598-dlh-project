        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper selected for this project is titled \"Predicting intraoperative hypotension using deep learning with waveforms of arterial blood pressure, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram: Retrospective study\" [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background of the problem\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem being investigated by this study relates to the prediction of Intraoperative Hypotension (IOH). IOH is an event that can occur during durgery where there is a drop in mean arterial blood pressure to less than 65 mmHg. This event is important to consider because it can be associated with multiple negative postoperative outcomes including postoperative myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and postoperative mortality. There are multiple factors that can contribute to instances of IOH, and if there were an ability to identify IOH in advance then medical personnel could take steps to mitigate the IOH event. This is important because a prevention or minimization of IOH events may reduce the probability of the negative postoperative outcomes described above. The paper is an investigation into the problem of IOH event prediction, specifically predicting whether, based on vital signals, there will be an IOH event in 7, 5, 10, or 15 minutes time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our selected paper is an extension of another study titled \"Machine-learning Algorithm to Predict Hypotension Based on High-fidelity Arterial Pressure Waveform Analysis\" [2], which attempted to train a model to predict instances of Intraoperative Hypotension using Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signals. While that original paper focused solely on training against arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms, our selected paper seeks to measure whether predictive outcomes are improved by incorporating additional vital signals. Specifically, the paper investigates the impact to quality of IOH prediction by training not only on ABP signals, but also electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and various combination of all three.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difficulty in this area of research is that the benefit of a predictive model would occur only by the use of such a model within a surgical environment. This paper does not aim to demonstrate the feasibility of operating a realtime signal analysis model, instead focusing on the potential predictive benefits of incorporating vital signals beyond ABP in order to improve the quality of predictions for IOH events.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this paper is an investigation into the augmentation of ABP signal analysis with additional vital signals, the state of the art for IOH prediction involves models that have been incorporated into medical devices that are deployed in the operating room. A recently published study titled \"AcumenTM hypotension prediction index guidance for prevention and treatment of hypotension in noncardiac surgery: a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial\" [3] wherein the predictive models were used during surgeries. The participants clinicians were warned by the predictive technology and enabled to intervene and prevent or reduce the duration of IOH events. The conclusion of the AcumenTM paper determined that the use of such prediction software was associated with a clinically meaningful reudction in the duration of IOH events, but that further studies are required to investigate whether these models could be used to prevent IOH events entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Paper\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper proposed that training a model on some combination of ABP, ECG, and EEG signals would improve result in a model that would function better at predicting IOH. The key innovation relative to preceding research in this area is the inclusion of EEG and ECG signal data in the operation of the model, whereas preceding research focused primarily on making predictions based solely on ABP data. The paper concluded that the combination of ABP and EEG signals may result in improved model performance when predicting IOH events. The experimental results demonstrated that by both area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) measures, a model trained on the combination of ABP and EEG scored higher than a model trained solely on ABP across all prediction intervals (i.e., for predictions 7, 5, 10, and 15 minutes ahead of an IOH event). The main contribution to the research regime for prediction IOH is that it validates the hypothesis that a combination of vital signals able to monitored during surgery will improve predictive quality. While that benefit is marginal, this research provides a quantifiable measure to demonstrate the magnitude of this improvement."

To test hypothesis 2 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 3. To test hypothesis 3 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 4.

Each signal will pass through 12 instances of the residual block before being flattened and passed through a linear layer ultimately producing 32 parameters. Each signal path will then be concatenated (unless only one signal was configured for use). This concatenated set will be passed through two more linear layers to produce a single vector representing the IOH index. A threshold value would be subsequently applied to this index to perform the binary classification determining whether or not an IOH event is being predicted. This means that each signal passes through 85 layers before concatenation, and then 2 more linear layers before the prediction measure is produced.\n",
