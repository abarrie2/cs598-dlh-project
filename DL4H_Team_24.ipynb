    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to reproduce findings from the paper titled \"Predicting intraoperative hypotension using deep learning with waveforms of arterial blood pressure, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram: Retrospective study\" by Jo Y-Y et al. (2022) [1]. This study introduces a deep learning model that predicts intraoperative hypotension (IOH) events before they occur, utilizing a combination of arterial blood pressure (ABP), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a common and significant surgical complication defined by a mean arterial pressure drop below 65 mmHg. It is associated with increased risks of myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and heightened postoperative mortality. Effective prediction and timely intervention can substantially enhance patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution of IOH Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial attempts to predict IOH primarily used arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. A foundational study by Hatib F et al. (2018) titled \"Machine-learning Algorithm to Predict Hypotension Based on High-fidelity Arterial Pressure Waveform Analysis\" [2] showed that machine learning could forecast IOH events using ABP with reasonable accuracy. This finding spurred further research into utilizing various physiological signals for IOH prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent advancements included the development of the Acumen™ hypotension prediction index, which was studied in \"AcumenTM hypotension prediction index guidance for prevention and treatment of hypotension in noncardiac surgery: a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial\" by Bao X et al. (2024) [3]. This trial integrated a hypotension prediction index into blood pressure monitoring equipment, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the number and duration of IOH events during surgeries. Further study is needed to determine whether this resultant reduction in IOH events transalates into improved postoperative patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these advancements, the paper by Jo Y-Y et al. (2022) proposes a deep learning approach that enhances prediction accuracy by incorporating EEG and ECG signals along with ABP. This multi-modal method, evaluated over prediction windows of 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes, aims to provide a comprehensive physiological profile that could predict IOH more accurately and earlier. Their results indicate that the combination of ABP and EEG significantly improves performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC, outperforming models that use fewer signals or different combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to reproduce and verify Jo Y-Y et al.'s results to assess whether this integrated approach can indeed improve IOH prediction accuracy, thereby potentially enhancing surgical safety and patient outcomes."

    "## Scope of Reproducibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper investigated the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Hypothesis 1: A model using ABP and ECG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "2.   Hypothesis 2: A model using ABP and EEG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "3.   Hypothesis 3: A model using ABP, EEG, and ECG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results were compared using AUROC and AUPRC scores. Based on the results described in the original paper, we expect that Hypothesis 2 will be confirmed, and that Hypotheses 1 and 3 will not be confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the corresponding experiments, we will implement a CNN-based model that can be configured to train and infer using the following four model variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   ABP data alone\n",
    "2.   ABP and ECG data\n",
    "3.   ABP and EEG data\n",
    "4.   ABP, ECG, and EEG data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the performance of these configurations using the same AUROC and AUPRC metrics as used in the original paper. To test hypothesis 1 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 2. To test hypothesis 2 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 3. To test hypothesis 3 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 4. For all of the above measures and experiment combinations, we will operate multiple experiments where the time-to-IOH event prediction will use the following prediction windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 3 minutes before event\n",
    "2. 5 minutes before event\n",
    "3. 10 minutes before event\n",
    "4. 15 minutes before event\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the functioning of the code in a short (ie, <8 minute limit) the following options and modifications were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `MAX_CASES` was set to 20. The total number of cases to be used in the full training set is 3296, but the smaller numbers allows demonstration of each section of the pipeline.\n",
    "2. `vitaldb_cache` is prepopulated in Google Colab. The cache file is approx. 800MB and contains the raw and mini-fied copies of the source dataset and is downloaded from Google Drive. This is much faster than using the `vitaldb` API, but is again only a fraction of the data. The full dataset can be downloaded with the API or prepopulated by following the instructions in the \"Bulk Data Download\" section below.\n",
    "3. `max_epochs` is set to 6. With the small dataset, training is fast and shows the decreasing training and validation losses. In the full model run, `max_epochs` will be set to 100. In both cases early stopping is enabled and will stop training if the validation losses stop decreasing for five consecutive epochs.\n",
    "4. Only the \"ABP + EEG\" combination will be run. In the final report, additional combinations will be run, as discussed later.\n",
    "5. Only the 3-minute prediction window will be run. In the final report, additional prediction windows (5, 10 and 15 minutes) will be run, as discussed later.\n",
    "6. No ablations are run in the demo. These will be completed for the final report."

    "\n",
    "The architecture, as depicted in Figure 2 from the original paper, utilizes a ResNet-based approach tailored for time-series data from different physiological signals. The model architecture is adapted to handle varying input signal frequencies, with specific hyperparameters for each signal type, particularly EEG, due to its distinct characteristics compared to ABP and ECG. A diagram of the model architecture is shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each input signal is processed through a sequence of 12 7-layer residual blocks, followed by a flattening process and a linear transformation to produce a 32-dimensional feature vector per signal type. These vectors are then concatenated (if multiple signals are used) and passed through two additional linear layers to produce a single output vector, representing the IOH index. A threshold is determined experimentally in order to minimize the differene between the sensitivity and specificity and is applied to this index to perform binary classification for predicting IOH events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters for the residual blocks are specified in Supplemental Table 1 from the original paper and vary for different signal type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A forward pass through the model passes through 85 layers before concatenation, followed by two more linear layers and finally a sigmoid activation layer to produce the prediction measure.\n",

    "Each residual block consists of the following seven layers:\n",

    "## Implications of experimental results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducibility of original paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we were not able to achieve the same performance level as the original paper, we were able to perform all of the same experiments and test the hypotheses. The results of our experiments were ultimately consistent with the original paper, or consistent from prediction window to prediction window, or metric to metric, and we were unable to prove or disprove any of the three hypotheses. The hyperparameter search and ablation study results were consistent with the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our best models, we were able to generate predictions for cases and then plot the predicted values (probability of an IOH event) and compare it to to mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the raw ABP waveform. The predictions would increase prior to the MAP beginning to drop and decrease as the MAP recovered. For sustained periods of MAP below 65 mmHg the model predictions would become high and remain high for the duration of the IOH event. These results were consistent with similar prediction plots presented in `Figure 3` of the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the discrepancy in performance between our results and the original paper is mostly due to the differences in datasets and data preprocessing. The original paper used a dataset with 39,600 cases, of which 14,140 met the inclusion and exclusion critera and were used for training. The authors released a much smaller dataset publically with only 6,388 cases, of which 2,763 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This smaller dataset provided less data for training and validation, which likely impacted the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper also used a signal quality index to filter out low-quality data, which we were not able to implement. This likely introduced noise into our dataset, which likely impacted the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original paper also used a different data preprocessing pipeline than we did, and did not precisely document it. This lead us to try various data preprocessing methods to try to match the original paper's results, but we were not able to achieve the same performance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors affecting reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward aspects of this project were the data download and the model implementation. Specific areas were we encountered low difficulty:\n",
    "- The data download was straightforward, as the dataset was available through a convenient API through Python library as well as being published to Physionet for download.\n",
    "- The model architecture was generally clearly defined in the original paper with an included architecture diagram. The hyperparameters were provided in a supplemental table. These features made it easy to implement the model in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult aspects of this project all involved the data preprocessing stage. This is the most impactful part of the data pipeline and it was not fully documented in the original paper. Some areas were we encountered difficulty:\n",
    "- The source data is unlabelled, so our team was responsible for implementing analysis methods for identifying positive (IOH event occurred) and negative (IOH event did not occur) by running a lookahead analysis of our input training set. The original paper was not precise on how this was done, so we had to make some assumptions.\n",
    "- The volume of raw data is in excess of 90GB. A non-trivial amount of compute was required to minify the input data to only include the data tracks of interest to our experiments (i.e., ABP, ECG, and EEG tracks).\n",
    "- We found it difficult to trace back to the definition of the \"jSQI\" signal quality index referenced in the paper. Multiple references through multiple papers needed to be traversed to understand which variant of the quality index \n",
    "   - The only available source code related to the signal quality index as referenced by our paper in [5]. Source code was not directly linked from the paper, but the GitHub repository for the corresponding author for reference [5] did result in the identification of MATLAB source code for the signal quality index as described in the referenced paper. That code is available at https://github.com/cliffordlab/PhysioNet-Cardiovascular-Signal-Toolbox/tree/master/Tools/BP_Tools [7]\n",
    "   - Our team had insufficient time to port this signal quality index to Python for use in our investigation, or to setup a MATLAB environment in which to assess our source data using the above MATLAB functions. This is a potential source of noise in our dataset, as the signal quality index was used to filter out low-quality data in the original paper, and we were unable to do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unknowns\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of our results that we were unable to explain was why our threshold values were lower than expected. In the original paper, the threshold is chosen in order to minimize the difference between sensitivity and specificity, and we applied an algorithm to achieve this goal. However, in the original paper, the thresholds were between 0.30 and 0.62 while our results were between 0.14 and 0.34. We posited that this was due to the label imbalance (4 positive labels : 1 negative label) and performed experiments comparing different `pos_weight` values using the `BCEWithLogitsLoss` loss function with the `BCELoss` loss function fro the original paper. However, this did not yield better, or indeed any usable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggestions to original authors\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main suggestion to the original authors would be to release their code publically and to provide more detailed documentation of the data preprocessing pipeline. This would help future researchers to reproduce the results more accurately. Specifically, the authors should provide more information on how the signal quality index was calculated and used to filter out low-quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also suggestion correcting the hyperparameters published in Supplemental Table 1. Specifically, the output size for residual blocks 11 and 12 for the ECG and ABP data sets was 496x6. This is a typo, and should read 469x6. This typo became apparent when operating the size down operation within Residual Block 11 and recognizing the tensor dimensions were misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, more explicit references to the signal quality index assessment tools should be added. Our team could not find a reference to the MATLAB source code as described in reference [3], and had to manually discover the GitHub profile for the lab of the corresponding author of reference [3] in order to find MATLAB source that corresponded to the metrics described therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future work\n",
    "\n",
    "In future work, we would like to implement the signal quality index and use it to filter out low-quality data. We would also like to experiment with additional data preprocessing techniques and pre-filtered datasets such as PulseDB: a cleaned dataset based on MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Further, we would like to experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to see if we can improve the model's performance. Finally, we would like to run the models with different seeds to create a model ensemble in order to smooth some of the noise in our results."
