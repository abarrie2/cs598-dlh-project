    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to reproduce findings from the paper titled \"Predicting intraoperative hypotension using deep learning with waveforms of arterial blood pressure, electroencephalogram, and electrocardiogram: Retrospective study\" by Jo Y-Y et al. (2022) [1]. This study introduces a deep learning model that predicts intraoperative hypotension (IOH) events before they occur, utilizing a combination of arterial blood pressure (ABP), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a common and significant surgical complication defined by a mean arterial pressure drop below 65 mmHg. It is associated with increased risks of myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and heightened postoperative mortality. Effective prediction and timely intervention can substantially enhance patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution of IOH Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial attempts to predict IOH primarily used arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms. A foundational study by Hatib F et al. (2018) titled \"Machine-learning Algorithm to Predict Hypotension Based on High-fidelity Arterial Pressure Waveform Analysis\" [2] showed that machine learning could forecast IOH events using ABP with reasonable accuracy. This finding spurred further research into utilizing various physiological signals for IOH prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent advancements included the development of the Acumen™ hypotension prediction index, which was studied in \"AcumenTM hypotension prediction index guidance for prevention and treatment of hypotension in noncardiac surgery: a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial\" by Bao X et al. (2024) [3]. This trial integrated a hypotension prediction index into blood pressure monitoring equipment, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the number and duration of IOH events during surgeries. Further study is needed to determine whether this resultant reduction in IOH events transalates into improved postoperative patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these advancements, the paper by Jo Y-Y et al. (2022) proposes a deep learning approach that enhances prediction accuracy by incorporating EEG and ECG signals along with ABP. This multi-modal method, evaluated over prediction windows of 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes, aims to provide a comprehensive physiological profile that could predict IOH more accurately and earlier. Their results indicate that the combination of ABP and EEG significantly improves performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC, outperforming models that use fewer signals or different combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to reproduce and verify Jo Y-Y et al.'s results to assess whether this integrated approach can indeed improve IOH prediction accuracy, thereby potentially enhancing surgical safety and patient outcomes."

    "# Scope of Reproducibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper investigated the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Hypothesis 1: A model using ABP and ECG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "2.   Hypothesis 2: A model using ABP and EEG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "3.   Hypothesis 3: A model using ABP, EEG, and ECG will outperform a model using ABP alone in predicting IOH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results were compared using AUROC and AUPRC scores. Based on the results described in the original paper, we expect that Hypothesis 2 will be confirmed, and that Hypotheses 1 and 3 will not be confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the corresponding experiments, we will implement a CNN-based model that can be configured to train and infer using the following four model variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   ABP data alone\n",
    "2.   ABP and ECG data\n",
    "3.   ABP and EEG data\n",
    "4.   ABP, ECG, and EEG data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the performance of these configurations using the same AUROC and AUPRC metrics as used in the original paper. To test hypothesis 1 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 2. To test hypothesis 2 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 3. To test hypothesis 3 we will compare the AUROC and AUPRC measures between model variation 1 and model variation 4. For all of the above measures and experiment combinations, we will operate multiple experiments where the time-to-IOH event prediction will use the following prediction windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 3 minutes before event\n",
    "2. 5 minutes before event\n",
    "3. 10 minutes before event\n",
    "4. 15 minutes before event\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that we are compute-bound, we will prioritize the 3-minute prediction window experiments as they are the most relevant to the original paper's findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the functioning of the code in a short (ie, <8 minute limit) the following options and modifications were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `MAX_CASES` was set to 20. The total number of cases to be used in the full training set is 3296, but the smaller numbers allows demonstration of each section of the pipeline.\n",
    "2. `vitaldb_cache` is prepopulated in Google Colab. The cache file is approx. 800MB and contains the raw and mini-fied copies of the source dataset and is downloaded from Google Drive. This is much faster than using the `vitaldb` API, but is again only a fraction of the data. The full dataset can be downloaded with the API or prepopulated by following the instructions in the \"Bulk Data Download\" section below.\n",
    "3. `max_epochs` is set to 6. With the small dataset, training is fast and shows the decreasing training and validation losses. In the full model run, `max_epochs` will be set to 100. In both cases early stopping is enabled and will stop training if the validation losses stop decreasing for five consecutive epochs.\n",
    "4. Only the \"ABP + EEG\" combination will be run. In the final report, additional combinations will be run, as discussed later.\n",
    "5. Only the 3-minute prediction window will be run. In the final report, additional prediction windows (5, 10 and 15 minutes) will be run, as discussed later.\n",
    "6. No ablations are run in the demo. These will be completed for the final report."

    "The architecture, as depicted in Figure 2 from the original paper, utilizes a ResNet-based approach tailored for time-series data from different physiological signals. The model architecture is adapted to handle varying input signal frequencies, with specific hyperparameters for each signal type, particularly EEG, due to its distinct characteristics compared to ABP and ECG.

These vectors are then concatenated (if multiple signals are used) and passed through two additional linear layers to produce a single output vector, representing the IOH index. A threshold is determined experimentally in order to minimize the differene between the sensitivity and specificity and is applied to this index to perform binary classification for predicting IOH events.\n",

    "Our assessment is that this paper will be reproducible. The outstanding risk is that each experiment can take up to 7 hours to run on hardware within the team (i.e., 7h to run ~70 epochs on a desktop with AMD Ryzen 7 3800X 8-core CPU w/ RTX 2070 SUPER GPU and 32GB RAM). There are a total of 28 experiments (7 different combinations of signal inputs, 4 different time horizons for each combination). Should our team find it not possible to complete the necessary experiments across all of the experiments represented in Table 3 of our selected paper, we will reduce the number of experiments to focus solely on the ones directly related to our hypotheses described in the beginning of this notebook (i.e., reduce the number of combinations of interest to 4: ABP alone, ABP+EEG, ABP+ECG, ABP+ECG+EEG). This will result in a new total of 16 experiments to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned ablations\n",
    "Our proposal included a collection of potential ablations to be investigated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove ResNet skip connection\n",
    "* Reduce # of residual blocks from 12 to 6\n",
    "* Reduce # of residual blocks from 12 to 1\n",
    "* Eliminate dropout from residual block\n",
    "* Max pooling configuration\n",
    "  * smaller size/stride\n",
    "  * eliminate max pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the amount of time required to conduct each experiment, our team intends to choose only a small number of ablations from this set. Further, we only intend to perform ablation analysis against the best performing signal combination and time horizon from the reproduction experiments. In order words, we intend to perform ablation analysis against the following training combinations, and only against the models trained with data measured 3 minutes prior to an IOH event:\n",
    "  * ABP alone\n",
    "  * ABP + ECG\n",
    "  * ABP + EEG\n",
    "  * ABP + ECG + EEG\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and GPU resource permitting, we will complete a broader range of experiments. For additional details, please see the section below titled \"Plans for next phase\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nature of reproduced results\n",
    "Our team intends to address the manner in which the experimental results align with the published results in the paper in the final submission of this report. The amount of time required to complete model training and result analysis during the preparation of the Draft notebook was not sufficient to complete a large number of experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was easy? What was difficult?\n",
    "The difficult aspect of the preparation of this draft involved the data preprocessing.\n",
    " * First, the source data is unlabelled, so our team was responsible for implementing analysis methods for identifying positive (IOH event occurred) and negative (IOH event did not occur) by running a lookahead analysis of our input training set.\n",
    " * Second, the volume of raw data is in excess of 90GB. A non-trivial amount of compute was required to minify the input data to only include the data tracks of interest to our experiments (i.e., ABP, ECG, and EEG tracks).\n",
    " * Third, our team found it difficult to trace back to the definition of the jSQI signal quality index referenced in the paper. Multiple references through multiple papers needed to be traversed to understand which variant of the quality index \n",
    "   * The only available source code related to the signal quality index as referenced by our paper in [5]. Source code was not directly linked from the paper, but the GitHub repository for the corresponding author for reference [5] did result in the identification of MATLAB source code for the signal quality index as described in the referenced paper. That code is available here: https://github.com/cliffordlab/PhysioNet-Cardiovascular-Signal-Toolbox/tree/master/Tools/BP_Tools\n",
    "   * Our team had insufficient time to port this signal quality index to Python for use in our investigation, or to setup a MATLAB environment in which to assess our source data using the above MATLAB functions, but we expect to complete this as part of our final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions to paper author\n",
    "The most notable suggestion would be to correct the hyperparameters published in Supplemental Table 1. Specifically, the output size for residual blocks 11 and 12 for the ECG and ABP data sets was 496x6. This is a typo, and should read 469x6. This typo became apparent when operating the size down operation within Residual Block 11 and recognizing the tensor dimensions were misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, more explicit references to the signal quality index assessment tools should be added. Our team could not find a reference to the MATLAB source code as described in reference [3], and had to manually discover the GitHub profile for the lab of the corresponding author of reference [3] in order to find MATLAB source that corresponded to the metrics described therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plans for next phase\n",
    "Our team plans to accomplish the following goals in service of preparing the Final Report:\n",
    " * Implement the jSQI filter to remove any training data with aberrent signal quality per the threshold defined in our original paper.\n",
    " * Execute the following experiments:\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained solely with ABP data at 3 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+ECG data at 3 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+EEG data at 3 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+ECG+EEG data at 3 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    " * Gather our measures for these experiments and perform a comparison against the published results from our selected paper and determine whether or not we are succesfully reproducing the results outlined in the paper.\n",
    " * Ablation analysis:\n",
    "   * Execute the following ablation experiments:\n",
    "     * Repeat the four experiments described above while reducing the numnber of residual blocks in the model from 12 to 6.\n",
    " * Time- and/or GPU-resource permitting, we will complete the remaining 24 experiments as described in the paper:\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained solely with ABP data at 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+ECG data at 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+EEG data at 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ABP+ECG+EEG data at 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained solely with ECG data at 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained solely with EEG data at 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Measure predictive quality of the model trained with ECG+EEG data at 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to IOH events.\n",
    "   * Additional ablation experiments:\n",
    "     * For the four core experiments (ABP, ABP+ECG, ABP+EEG, ABP+ECG+EEG each trained on event data occurring 3 minutes prior to IOH events), perform the following ablations:\n",
    "       * Repeat experiment while eliminating dropout from every residual block\n",
    "       * Repeat experiment while removing the skip connection from every residual block\n",
    "       * Repeat the four experiments described above while reducing the numnber of residual blocks in the model from 12 to 1."
